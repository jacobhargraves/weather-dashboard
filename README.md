# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This application allows a user to view weather data for a city.  It will show them the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, wind, and humidity for the current day as well as a five day forecast.  The user can search multiple cities and they will be saved in a recent searches section on the page.  Upon clicking those recent searches, the user can again view the weather data for each of those cities without having to retype the city name.

## Usage

To use this application, please visit: https://jacobhargraves.github.io/weather-dashboard/

To view a city's weather data, simply enter the name of the city you wish to view.  Click submit and the api will retrieve the weather data for that city. To view another city's weather data again just type the city name and click submit.  Each search will be stored on the page as a button which the user can click to quickly view that weather data again.
